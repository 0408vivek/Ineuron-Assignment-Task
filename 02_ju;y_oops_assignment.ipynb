    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors (methods) from another class. Inheritance forms a hierarchy of classes, where a new class can be created based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors while also having the ability to extend or override them. The existing class is referred to as the \"base class,\" \"parent class,\" or \"superclass,\" while the new class is the \"derived class,\" \"child class,\" or \"subclass.\""
